# Landing Page - FWD's professional track first project
## Sarah Ihab Hanafy

**Description**
This project required me to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

**Behavior and Specifications**
- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
- It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

- Styling has been added for active states.
- There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.
